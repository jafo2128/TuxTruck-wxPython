Changelog

Version 1.0
----
Added time to progress bar since MPlayer finally supports it.  Users with
older MPlayers should still get the percentage readout.

Removed popup tip.  A proper implementation of the widgets required to do
this correctly is slated for gtk+ 2.12, at which time I'll revisit it.

Starting pymp with targets specified on the command line now checks for a
running instance and remotely adds targets, rather than starting a new 
instance.  This is very handy if you open a playlist while you're listening
to something else.

Added Gtk AboutDialog, ability to visit website via click.

Fixed small non-crash bug when quitting while not playing a track.

Version 0.9
----
Added .pls playlist file support

Popup tip only shows with user event

Playlist scrolls with mouse wheel

Many new key controls:
  <, > previous, next target
  <left>, <right> rewind, forward
  s, p stop, pause

New Gtk+ 2.6 stock buttons in control panel

Url targets are no longer basename'd
