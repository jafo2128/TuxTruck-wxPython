In order to be optimized for use with TuxTruck, playlists are stored in a
custom format. Like other configuration files, they are XML files.

NOTE: At this time, TuxTruck only accepts playlists in TuxTruck Playlist XML
format (the format described here). It is recommended that you do NOT
hand-code playlists. Import scripts for .m3u and other formats will be
forthcoming.

A playlist is simply a file that contains information on a list of songs to
play, in sequence (or randomly).

The playlist format is as follows:
<TuxTruck_Playlist>
  <type>{artist|genre|album|path|ALL}</type>
  <name>Playlist Name</name>
  <songs>
  { playlist entries...}
  </songs>
</TuxTruck_Playlist>

Each playlist entry is composed of eight (8) values, as follows:
- filepath: the path to the file, RELATIVE to mp3root as defined in
settings/audio.xml (string)
- displayname: the string that is displayed for the file, in the playlist list
box and in the "current song" box. This is generated by the scripts and is
typically of the format "Artist - Title (Album)" (string)
- title: the title of the song (string)
- artist (string)
- album (string)
- genre (string)
- length (total, in seconds, integer)
- rank (as explained elsewhere in the docs) (integer, -1, 0, or 1) defaults to 0.

The format, for each entry, is:

<playlist_entry>
  <filepath>path/to/file.ext</filepath>
  <displayname>Artist - Title (Album)</displayname>
  <title>Song Title</title>
  <artist>Song Artist</artist>
  <album>Song Album</album>
  <genre>Song Genre (string)</genre>
  <length>1234</length>
  <rank>{-1|0|1}(integer)</rank>
</playlist_entry>

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: A playlist entry should be as complete as
possible. Missing fields may prevent correct playing, and will definitely
prevent proper display of song information, and searching.
ASSUMPTIONS (keep this in mind when coding or editing playlists:
1) TuxTruck assumes that all playlists will be properly formatted.
2) All field values are assumed to be the right data type - string or int.
3) Missing fields WILL create problems. At the minimum, each entry should have
displayname and filepath defined.
4) All searching is based on the playlist entries, and the
search-type-specific playlists (i.e. artists, genre, etc.). If an entry does
not appear in the type-specific playlist AND it does not have an appropriate
value for that type, it won't show up in search results.

NOTE: Playlists should only be updated from the buildPlaylists script.
