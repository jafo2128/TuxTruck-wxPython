Nomenclature

Within this document, we use the term "screen" to refer to the interface
presented on the screen. There are main "modes" - home, navigation, OBD,
phone, weather, audio, etc. Each of which may have multiple "screens"
(wxWidgets panels). When a main mode is referred to without explicitly
specifying a sub-screen, we're referring to the default screen for that mode -
the one that comes up when the mode button is first pressed.

The term "window" is usually used to refer to the entire screen area generated
by TuxTruck. It is a wxWidgets frame, but most people are used to referring to
it as a window, as this is how your window manager treats it.
